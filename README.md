# Wicka Brochure Site

This is a repository for a **React Router**, **node/Express** website. The website acts as a brochure and download platform to a video game I designed using the **Unreal Engine**. The video game is called **Wicka** and features third-person fantasy combat.

The site consists of 4 pages:
```
* home
* grimoire
* about
* download
```
and contains custom spritesheets that I created using **Maya**, the **Unreal Engine**, **iMovie**, and the **Python PIL** library, as well as other media, such as images and gifs.

The homepage features an interactive character that animates when the user 'mouses-over' the character, and blinking monster eyes, that are randomly-placed each time the page loads.

The site features a short 'about' page as well as an in-depth deep-dive 'grimoire' page that touches on the various game mechanics featured in the game.

Finally, the 'download' page allows users to download the game to their home computer.

## Future Improvements

### Slow-loading media
The site's media sometimes loads slowly, depending on the user's internet connection and remains the focus of future improvements. The 'lazy-loading' of off-screen media may improve performance as well as compressing or resizing the media.

### CSS 'grimoire' page
The CSS of the 'grimoire' page, specifically the 'navbar', 'content', and the 'page controls' HTML elements should be changed to better adapt to a changing page height.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
